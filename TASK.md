in src/nvram/compare-nvram.ts there's a CLI tool for comparing nvram values. Your task will be to design and create a web app (built with bun + react + tailwind 4) that can do the same visually in a high quality UI for both comparing and editing NVRAM values - a browser/editor that uses the src/nvram/nvram.ts catalog to generate the UI, and a fallback for not values not in the catalog. Values should be grouped by page (as per the catalog properties). The flow upon start should be that there is a dropzone for a .cfg file that will be converted to an object using src/nvram/nvram-cfg.ts. This allows previewing the file in a human readable way, with field descriptions and editing capabilities. You may then drop an additional file to see and highlight the differences between the two, new fields, deleted fields, and filter each page/section to only see the differences. The UI should be highly functional, yet beautiful. You can select what changes you want to apply from LEFT/RIGHT or do a custom edit, and finally after making edits, you can preview those changes, and download a new .cfg file (or view a script with nvram set commands that can be copy and pasted directly to ssh).
